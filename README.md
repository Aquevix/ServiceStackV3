### Support

Whilst there is no official direct or commercial support for the legacy v3 releases, StackOverflow remains the optimal place to ask for support. Please also include the `#servicestack-v3` hashtag when [Asking a new question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask).

[Service Stack](https://servicestack.net) still maintains continuous integration builds and publishes monthly periodic releases of ServiceStack v3 to NuGet. As there is no manual Q/A process for v3 releases, any new fixes contributed **must** be accompanied by unit or integration tests verifying the fix and **must not** change existing behavior or cause any regressions on the existing test suite. 

See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3/wiki/Contributing) for more details.
